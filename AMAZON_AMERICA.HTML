 		<p>What we love about the Amazon is that there is always an adventure. Anywhere you go, you’ll take a different method of transport between small boats to luxury ones or even kayaks. 
 			<br>Our favourite way to get out and enjoy the Amazon adventure is to use tandem kayaks</p>

	<p><b><font size="50">Plaza de Armas de Iquitos</font></b><br><br>
 		 Head to the port city of Iquitos in Peru for a fascinating visit, including a stroll around the Plaza de Armas. This busy central plaza sits among European-styled buildings built during the <br>historic rubber boom. Relax here in between your trips to the jungle and shopping along with the open-street markets. <br>Sit beside the fountain, admire the public garden, enjoy the shade of a palm tree, or check out the monument to those Peruvians who died during the 1879-83 Pacific War.

 		Take your time admiring the delicate orchids, grassy ferns, vibrant bromeliads, and various twisting and tangled vines. You can access the reserve from the city of Puerto Maldonado <br>in the southeastern part of Peru.

 	<p><b><font size="50">Pacaya Samiria National Reserve</b><br><br></font>
 		 Wildlife lives in the tops of the trees here, and you’ll be able to get a closer look at them. If you’re feeling particularly brave or looking to experience an extra thrill, make your way <br>across the La Posado canopy bridge for a spectacular view of this diverse ecosystem.
